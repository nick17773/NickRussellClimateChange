        <h2>Why HFCs and CFCs?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) do not have a natural origin, but have been synthesised for such varied uses as refrigerants, aerosols and cleaning solvents. They were created in 1928 and levels of CFCs in the atmosphere have risen since then. Because of the discovery that they can destroy stratospheric ozone, a worldwide effort has been conducted and has been highly effective in stopping their manufacturing. The levels of the main CFCs are now remaining the same or decreasing. However, their lengthy lifetime in the atmosphere means that some CFC concentration will stay in the atmosphere for more than 100 years. New compounds called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were created to replace them, and do not destroy ozone. However, although HFCs do not destroy the ozone like CFCs, they are a destructive greenhouse gas. All greenhouse gases operate by absorbing radiation that would otherwise escape into space. However, the different greenhouse gases have a "global warming potential" which measure their strength compared to carbon dioxide. CO₂ has a global warming potential of 1 and Methane has a global warming potential of 34. The global warming potential ranges from a staggering 1,370 to 4,180 for the three most abundant HFCs.

        <h2>How are these damaging to the environment and mankind?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>As both of these groups are entirely man-made, the amount of damage we expect them to do would be just lower than CO2, right? Well no, these "Super gasses" are way more harmful to the environment than CO2, 23,000 times more in fact. So the damage these cause, we would expect, would be a very long list of scary words etc, and You'd be right there. To put it short, these gasses will linger in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and will have the same impact that CO2 does, but on a much larger scale. But CFCs will also do a lot of damage, as they will produce what scientists call "ground level ozone", which will cause large amounts of damage to plants, animals and materials on the local scale. Both of these are harmful to human health, with CFCs being much more potent, it seems. The ingestion of CFCs will cause nausea, irritation of the digestive tract and diarrhoea. And this is only the ingestion of CFCs. The exposure to CFCs on the skin will cause skin irritation and dermatitis. General symptoms of exposure to this group of gases include: drowsiness, slurred speech, disorientation, tingling sensations and weakness in the limbs. Large amounts, as most of these deadly chemicals will result in death.</p>

        <h2>What is/has been done to limit these?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>As of 1987, the use of these gasses has been banned by the <a href="https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">Montreal Protocol</a> which was drafted to reduce the amount of substances that deplete the ozone layer.</p>
