        <h2>Why Nitrous Oxide?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Approximately 66% of manmade nitrous oxide emissions come from farming. Nitrous oxides are released from the nitrogen in fertiliser, manure and crop residues. The next most significant sources are burning fossil fuels for energy and transport, which accounts for 15% of emissions, and forest fires and biomass cookstoves at 11%.

        <h2>How is Nitrous Oxide damaging to the environment and mankind?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>At the beginning of the industrial revolution, concentrations of nitrous oxide also began to rise and are understood to be produced by microbial processes in soil and water, including reactions in nitrogen-containing fertiliser. The nitrogen dissolves in soil and runoff, which ultimately flows into the sea, when individuals add nitrogen-rich fertilizers to crops and lawns. These fertilisers have been used more and more over the last century. Nitrogen also flows out of septic tanks in strongly settled coastal regions (human waste, like other manure types, is rich in nitrogen) or turns to vapour over soil and rains or blows out to sea. Once the N2O molecule enters the upper atmosphere, it can remain there for over 100 years before it is naturally demolished.
            <br>Below is an image of model of a septic tank that I made:

        <h2>What has been done to limit Nitrous Oxide?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Using no-till rotation methods in farm fields can considerably reduce field emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide by 57%.  Nitrification inhibitors are chemicals applied to soils during the nitrification phase of the process to slow the microbial transformation of ammonium to nitrate. Another initiative is to decrease the stock time on paddocks. This can be done using stand-offs, which is a pad where cows, for example, can stand for periods of time.  The pad collects the faeces and urine (containing nitrogen) so that it does not go onto the paddocks in a concentrated form.  It is also important to keep stock off saturated soil because the bacteria do not have access to oxygen for growth and reproduction, so they use nitrate instead. This leads to N2O being released. There are also online tools that farmers can use to determine the fertiliser needs of their farm and the resulting risk for greenhouse gas emissions.
