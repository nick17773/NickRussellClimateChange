        <h2>Why Methane?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Methane gas is used in cooking. Methane is lighter than air, so compared to oil and coal it generates more energy per unit weight. It is also preferred for cooking as it has no smell and does not leave soot on the implements used for cooking. Methane gas is used for lighting. It is possible to use methane gas to produce electricity for households, offices and manufacturing. Methane gas can be used to make other compounds. Methane gas is vital for methanol (methyl alcohol), a main component of alcohol, to be formed. It is also used in the artificial production of hydrogen. Methane gas is an ingredient of hydrochloric acid used in laboratories. Chloroform which is used as a solvent and an anaesthetic, requires methane gas. Methane gas can be used to run machinery. Methane gas is used in factories to operate engines and turbines. Methane gas is used to produce fertiliser. Methane gas is used to produce ammonia (with the addition of hydrogen), which is a main ingredient in fertiliser production. Methane gas is used as rocket fuel. It is ideal as leaves no residue, and less carbon deposits.

        <h2>How is Methane gas damaging to the environment and mankind?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Methane (CH4) is a highly efficient radiation absorber. Its lifetime in the atmosphere is short (10-12 years) compared to some other greenhouse gases which is good news, however it's much more disastrous at first as Methane is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the first two decades after its release. Human actions such as rice growing, cattle raising, natural gas and coal mining have advanced the concentration of methane in the atmosphere over the last 50 years.
            <br> Below is a model I created of a (simple) Coal mine:

        <h2>What has been done to limit Methane gas?</h2>
        <p>Organic farming has helped, as instead of replacing older cows with younger calves, organic farmers keep livestock longer. As young calves do not generate milk, but still add to methane gas, less cows means less methane gas in the atmosphere. Also moving away from red meat consumption will improve methane gas emissions, as there will be fewer cows contributing to methane emissions if the quantity of red meat eaten is restricted. There have also been community measures to limit methane gas. Landfills generate methane. Many groups are working to transform methane from a toxin into energy.
